# Session slides and demo scripts from PSConfAsia 2017

**Note to Speakers**:

- Please add a folder with your name, and then make a folder below that for each of your sessions, putting the all of the demos for each session into a .zip file.
- DO NOT update README.md with your sessions - one of us (Jaap or Amanda) will update the table after we accept your pull request. It is less work for us this way.
- If you would prefer not to mess with GitHub, give Amanda or Jaap a shout, and we will add your session materials to the repository for you :)
